# Project Maze solver 3000

The Maze sovler 3000 is a learning resource which demonstrates the operations that are perfromed by searching algorithms when attempting to solve a uniquely generated maze.

This application is a resource to be used by teachers educating their students on the algorithms: Breadth first search and Depth first search.

How to run:
 - Download all files 
 - Run "main.py" using a python compiler/IDE (Pycharm recommended) 

Controls:
 - Application is controlled mainly using the buttons seen in the GUI allowing the user to:
    * Generate new mazes
    * Control what algorithm is used to solve the maze
    * Control the size of the maze
 - The user can return to the Main menu by using the "escape key" 

Check back for updates as we intend to implement more algorithms and features in the future.

Any bugs or issues found within the program please dont hesitate to email: Group32.Lincoln.TSE@gmail.com
